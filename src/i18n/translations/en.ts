  'about.intro.p1': 'A software engineer, indie developer, and the curator of this space — "Ninth Bit".',
  'about.intro.p2': 'Coming from a finance background, I\'ve been immersed in the world of code for over five years. This journey began with a fascination for low-level technologies, from C/C++ to the compiler of the domestic programming language "Cangjie", and then to the multi-threaded architecture of high-performance backend services. I enjoy unraveling complex systems and pinpointing issues. My experience at Huawei gave me the opportunity to build language services for platforms like VS Code and LeetCode, and to dive deep into the HarmonyOS ecosystem, using AI and expert knowledge to "troubleshoot" for leading apps like Feishu and Douyin.',
  'about.intro.p3': 'Outside of work, I\'m an explorer who can\'t stop. When the AI wave arrived, I dove headfirst into the world of AI Native and Agents as an indie developer. From modifying Zhipu\'s AutoGLM to exploring the future of automated testing based on Alibaba\'s MAIUI, I\'m fascinated by turning "wild ideas" into reality with code. This process has transformed me from a pure backend developer into a full-stack engineer capable of mastering React and Next.js.',
  'about.intro.p4': 'I believe in pragmatism, convinced that technology should ultimately create "useful" things; at the same time, I can\'t tolerate rough products and have an almost obsessive pursuit of "beautiful" and "usable". This contradictory combination is perhaps my unique label as an engineer.',
  'about.intro.p5': '"Ninth Bit" is the digital identity I\'ve created for myself. In the world of computers, a byte consists of 8 bits, representing established rules and boundaries. The "ninth bit" symbolizes that "extra bit" beyond convention, exploring the unknown — it\'s creativity, imagination, and the persistence to not settle for "just good enough".',
  'about.intro.p6': 'In this space, I\'ll share my technical thoughts, project practices, and various insights about AI and the future. I also have a strong interest in traditional thoughts like Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Wang Yangming\'s philosophy of mind, so you might occasionally see some "not-so-technical" writings here.',
  'about.intro.p7': 'I believe in the power of language, whether it\'s code or words. For me, sharing and expression are the best ways to grow.',
