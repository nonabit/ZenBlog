### 1. The Origin

Why do we start? Not to arrive somewhere, but to confirm existence in the flux. Even the smallest origin point is the beginning of all possibilities.

*Why do we start? Not to arrive, but to confirm existence in the flux.*

### 2. The State

**Introspection** — Looking inward. Preserving the right to "empty your mind" amidst the noise, like clearing context to make room for the next spark of inspiration.

**Values** — Even if ordinary, refuse to be mediocre. What keeps us going is often not grand goals, but those hidden yet steadfast values.

**Resonance** — From self to others. All creation and expression ultimately aim to let those around us feel more beautiful echoes.

### 3. The Growth

Dreams don't need to be defined as a specific destination. They are a continuous "state"—

**Keep growing through creation and expression.**

*Keep growing through creation and expression.*
