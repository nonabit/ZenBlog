MDX (Markdown JSX) is an incredibly powerful format. It's not just "styled text"—it's actually a **runtime environment that can run React components within your articles**.

This blog post itself is a demonstration. You can click the buttons below—they're not just images, but real, running code.

## 1. Basic Interaction: State Management

This is a React counter component fully embedded in Markdown. It has its own `useState` state and runs independently from the rest of the page.

<InteractiveCounter client:load />

Try clicking the `+` and `-` above. You'll see the number change in real-time. This means we can write **mini applications** inside blog posts!

## 2. Semantic Callouts

Plain Markdown blockquotes `>` are a bit boring. We can wrap a `<Callout />` component to convey information with different emotional tones.

<Callout type="info" title="Did you know?">
  Astro's MDX integration supports GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) by default, including tables and task lists.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Performance Tip">
  While MDX is powerful, note that every embedded React component adds to the page's JS bundle size. Use `client:visible` accordingly.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error" title="Common Mistake">
  Don't define complex React component logic directly in MDX. It's better to extract them into separate `.tsx` files and import them to keep your articles clean.
</Callout>

## 3. Embedded Voting (Interactive Poll)

Since MDX supports React, we can embed complex interactive logic in articles, like a real-time voting component. This is very useful for collecting reader feedback.

<Poll
  client:visible
  question="Which frontend framework do you prefer?"
  options={["React / Next.js", "Vue / Nuxt", "Svelte / SvelteKit", "Astro (The Best!)"]}
/>

When you click an option, you'll see a smooth animation showing simulated voting results. This demonstrates MDX's ability to handle user events and dynamic styles.

## 4. Data Visualization (Chart Demo)

Beyond code and text, MDX can easily handle complex data visualization. Here's an interactive line chart drawn with SVG and Framer Motion.

<ChartDemo client:visible />

## 5. Free-Form Animation Layout

The craziest part is that you can directly use Framer Motion's animation components to layout your text.

<AnimationDemo client:visible />

The two squares and the ball above are not GIF images—they're **real-time rendered DOM nodes**. This means they're vector, high-definition, and interactive.

## Conclusion

MDX blurs the line between "content" and "application." For technical blogs, it's a powerful tool for explaining complex concepts. You can:

1. Use interactive charts to explain algorithm complexity.
2. Use draggable sliders to demonstrate CSS property changes.
3. Use 3D models to showcase the magic of WebGL.

**The limit is your imagination.**
