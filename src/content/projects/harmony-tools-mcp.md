Here is a detailed breakdown of how I built this theme...

Project Overview

This theme was born out of frustration with existing blog templates that felt too "heavy". I wanted something that felt like a digital garden.

Key Features

Zero-JS by default: Using Astro's Island Architecture.

Typography First: Carefully selected font pairings (Newsreader + Inter).

Micro-interactions: Subtle animations using Framer Motion.

How to use

Clone the repo and run npm install.
